Assuming we have an image luksa/kubia:v1 deployed with name nodejs and replica count as 1 as follows:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubia
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      name: kubia
      labels:
        app: kubia
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: luksa/kubia:v1
        name: nodejs
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec:
  type: ClusterIP 
  selector:
    app: kubia
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080

Now if we want to change the image of the container nodejs to luksa/kubia:v2, then we need to do the following

kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2

Ideally to have zero downtime we need to have more than 1 replica and those should be on different nodes. Rolling updates help in zero downtime during rollout.
Also .spec.minReadySeconds field can be set to ensure newly created Pod should be ready for the specified time without any of its containers crashing,
for it to be considered available.
